Note: _cons estimates baseline odds.


Older people are less likely to rate their health as good (OR = 0.53).

As Higher education increases the odds of good health (OR = 1.33 for secondary, OR = 2.00 for higher).

For urban residents health is more likely 25% more better than rural

Scheduled Tribes have twice the odds (OR = 2.1) of good health compared to Scheduled Castes.

Hindus are having more good health (OR =0.86)then Christians(OR=0.75) and  Muslims(OR=0.76)


Wealth tells Rich people are  less likely (OR = 0.92) to rate their health as good.

Pseudo RÂ² = 2.75%  which is a significant predictors.
